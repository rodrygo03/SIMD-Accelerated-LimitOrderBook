# Development Scripts

Utility scripts for project setup, building, and testing automation.

## Scripts

- **`setup_dev_env.sh`**: Development environment initialization and dependencies
- **`build_and_test.sh`**: Automated build and test execution across configurations
- **`load_env.sh`**: Environment variable loading for build configuration

Scripts streamline development workflow and ensure consistent build environments across different optimization configurations.
